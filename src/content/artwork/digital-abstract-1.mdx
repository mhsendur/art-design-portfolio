# Digital Harmony #1

Created during my exploration of creative coding, this piece represents the intersection of mathematical precision and artistic intuition. Using p5.js, I developed an algorithm that generates organic color relationships based on Kandinsky's theories about the emotional properties of color.

## Creative Process

The composition emerges from a complex interplay of sine waves and random noise functions, creating forms that feel both natural and otherworldly. Each color is carefully selected from a palette inspired by sunset gradients, with opacity and blending modes creating depth and movement.

## Technical Approach

```javascript
// Core generation algorithm
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  let x = noise(i * 0.01, time * 0.001) * width;
  let y = noise(i * 0.01 + 100, time * 0.001) * height;
  let hue = map(x + y, 0, width + height, 180, 360);
  
  fill(hue, 80, 90, 0.6);
  ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);
}
```

This piece represents my ongoing investigation into how computational processes can generate genuinely expressive visual art.
