# Urban Moments: Intersection

This photograph was taken during one of my regular walks around Sabanci University campus, when I noticed how the morning light created this perfect moment of intersection between the geometric architecture and the organic flow of people.

## The Story Behind the Shot

I've always been fascinated by the way urban environments shape human behavior and movement. This particular morning, the interplay of shadows, reflections, and the purposeful stride of people heading to work created a composition that spoke to me about the rhythm of city life.

## Technical Notes

Shot with my Sony A7III using a 50mm lens, I chose a slightly wider aperture to maintain sharp focus on the subject while creating a subtle depth of field that isolates them from the busy background. The high contrast lighting was challenging, but I managed to preserve detail in both the shadows and highlights through careful exposure and post-processing.

## Artistic Vision

This image is part of my ongoing series documenting the intersection of individual human stories within larger urban narratives. I'm particularly drawn to moments where architecture and humanity create unexpected harmonies, revealing the poetry hidden within everyday commutes and routines.

Street photography has taught me to see design everywhereâ€”in the way people navigate spaces, in the unconscious patterns of movement, and in the emotional responses different environments evoke. These observations directly influence my UX design work, helping me understand how users actually experience and navigate digital spaces.
